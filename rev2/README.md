### WORK IN PROGRESS

#### Printing

Please note that this revision must be printed either with 0.12 mm layer height, or with adaptive layers enabled (recommended). 
What you're looking to achieve is that the last layer of the contact points for the side buttons ends at ~3.70 mm (±0.02 mm).
For example:

<img width="1546" height="733" alt="Screenshot From 2025-12-10 09-26-32" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cf340e3-95fd-47f2-8884-8c3a2443c119" />

<br /><br />
Enable Arachne walls if possible, and adjust minimum wall width to avoid gaps in the central area:

<img width="1235" height="591" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20e5a5a7-c65b-4a53-8973-534e9d867d48" />

Enable thick bridges and set bridge flow to 1.1 (110%). "Inner/Outer/Inner" walls order is recommended.
